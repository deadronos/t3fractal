# Product Context: Fractal Frontier

## Why This Project Exists

Fractal Frontier addresses the challenge of making complex mathematical concepts accessible and engaging through interactive gameplay. Traditional education often presents fractals as abstract mathematical curiosities, but this game transforms them into explorable universes that players can intuitively understand through hands-on interaction.

## Problems Solved

### Educational Challenges

- **Mathematical Intimidation**: Fractals are often seen as "too complex" for non-mathematicians
- **Abstract Concepts**: Difficulty visualizing infinite complexity and self-similarity
- **Lack of Intuition**: Students struggle to grasp how small changes create dramatic effects

### Gaming Challenges

- **Idle Game Saturation**: Many idle games lack educational value or unique themes
- **Repetitive Gameplay**: Need for meaningful progression that feels rewarding
- **Learning Integration**: Difficulty combining entertainment with genuine education

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey

1. **Discovery**: Player encounters a beautiful, mysterious fractal landscape
2. **Exploration**: Interactive zooming reveals infinite detail and complexity
3. **Resource Gathering**: Deeper exploration yields "Fractal Data" as a reward
4. **Automation**: Invest resources in "probes" and "algorithms" for passive collection
5. **Ascension**: Reset progress to gain permanent bonuses and explore new dimensions

### Educational Integration
