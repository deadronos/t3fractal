# TASK009 - Enhance Gameplay and Visuals

**Status:** In Progress
**Added:** 2025-10-10
**Updated:** 2025-10-10

## Original Request

Enhance gameplay and visuals, make fun assumptions and implement fully.

## Thought Process

The project currently lacks engaging gameplay loops and polished visuals. I'll build on the fractal exploration concept by introducing whimsical lore (e.g., cosmic cartographers), add core interactive mechanics (resource generation, upgrades, events), and enhance visuals with animated backgrounds and responsive UI feedback. The focus will stay aligned with the fractal exploration theme while providing a playful tone.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Audit existing components to identify extension points for gameplay features and styling.
- [x] Implement a whimsical resource and event system that makes the fractal frontier feel alive.
- [x] Add visual polish (animations, gradients, thematic styling) to reinforce the narrative.
- [x] Update UI components/pages to surface new mechanics and feedback loops.
- [x] Add automated tests covering new logic and rendering expectations.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
