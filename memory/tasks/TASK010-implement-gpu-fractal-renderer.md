# TASK010 - Implement GPU fractal renderer toggle

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-10-15
**Updated:** 2025-10-15

## Original Request

Rewrite the fractal renderer as a GPU shader (preferably React Three Fiber / drei ShaderMaterial), keep the current CPU renderer as a fallback, and allow toggling between them. Update the "Fractal Frontier" label to indicate whether the WebGL or CPU renderer is active.

## Thought Process

- Moving to a GPU shader should eliminate canvas flickering and tearing by rendering frames atomically on the GPU.
- Need to integrate React Three Fiber with the existing page without breaking current functionality.
- Provide a toggle UI so users can switch between CPU and GPU implementations.
- Update headings or labels dynamically to reflect the active renderer.
- Ensure graceful fallback to the CPU renderer in environments without WebGL support or when the GPU renderer is disabled.
- Keep the worker-based CPU renderer intact for comparison/testing until WebGL implementation is stable.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Investigate existing fractal viewer component structure and data flow.
- [x] Introduce a renderer mode state with options for CPU and WebGL.
- [x] Implement a React Three Fiber scene with a ShaderMaterial computing the Mandelbrot set on the GPU.
- [x] Render the GPU scene conditionally when WebGL mode is active; otherwise use the existing CPU canvas.
- [x] Add UI controls (toggle/button) for switching between renderers and update the on-screen title accordingly.
- [x] Ensure both renderers share configuration (viewport, parameters) where appropriate.
- [x] Update styles/tests/types as necessary.
- [x] Validate functionality manually and via automated checks.

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-15

- Recorded task requirements and initial plan for GPU shader renderer toggle.
- Implemented React Three Fiber shader-based renderer with CPU fallback toggle and dynamic heading label.
- Ran Prettier, Next.js lint, TypeScript no-emit, and Vitest to validate the implementation.
