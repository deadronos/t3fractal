# [TASK001] - Implement basic fractal rendering system

**Status:** In Progress
**Added:** October 8, 2025
**Updated:** October 8, 2025

## Original Request

Implement the core fractal rendering system for Fractal Frontier. This includes creating a FractalViewer component that can render Mandelbrot fractals using HTML5 Canvas, with basic zoom controls and color mapping.

## Thought Process

The fractal rendering is the core feature that defines this project. We need to start with a basic but functional implementation that can be built upon. The Mandelbrot set is the most iconic fractal and provides a good foundation.

Key considerations:

- Performance is critical - fractal calculations are computationally intensive
- Canvas API provides good performance for pixel-level rendering
- Need to balance accuracy with speed for real-time exploration
- Color mapping should be visually appealing and mathematically meaningful

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create FractalViewer React component with Canvas element
- [ ] Implement basic Mandelbrot calculation function
- [ ] Add Canvas rendering loop with pixel-by-pixel calculation
- [ ] Implement simple color mapping (iteration count to RGB)
- [ ] Add basic zoom controls (zoom in/out buttons)
- [ ] Integrate component into main page
- [ ] Test rendering performance and adjust calculation parameters

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 20% Complete
