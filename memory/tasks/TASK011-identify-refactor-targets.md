# [TASK011] - Identify refactor targets for modularization

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-10-26  
**Updated:** 2025-10-26

## Original Request

Identify five files or code paths that should be simplified and/or refactored into smaller, focused modules and document the findings in `/docs/tech-debt-refactor-report.md`.

## Thought Process

- The codebase has several large React components and utility modules that have grown organically through prior feature work.  
- A structured audit is needed to surface high-impact refactor candidates that will improve maintainability and enable modular development.  
- Findings should align with existing gameplay and rendering initiatives so the recommendations support upcoming work on Zustand state, fractal viewers, and UI polish.

## Implementation Plan

- **Analyze:**
  - Review repository instructions and existing memory artifacts.
  - Define EARS-style requirements capturing the audit goals.
  - Determine confidence score for tackling the task.
- **Design:**
  - Produce a lightweight technical design describing the assessment methodology, evaluation criteria, and error-handling matrix.
  - Break work into discrete subtasks tracked below.
- **Implement:**
  - Inspect candidate files, capturing complexity signals (size, mixed concerns, tight coupling).
  - Draft modularization recommendations with proposed subcomponents/modules.
- **Validate:**
  - Cross-check recommendations against requirements to ensure coverage of five distinct targets.
  - Peer-review internally by verifying rationale aligns with current architecture documents.
- **Reflect:**
  - Note any gaps or follow-up investigations for future tasks.
  - Update memory artifacts with lessons learned if needed.
- **Handoff:**
  - Deliver `/docs/tech-debt-refactor-report.md` with actionable recommendations.
  - Summarize validation status and remaining questions in final response.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
