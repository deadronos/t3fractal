# [TASK012] - Implement Tech Debt Refactors

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-10-26  
**Updated:** 2025-10-26

## Original Request

Implement the refactoring recommendations documented in `/docs/tech-debt-refactor-report.md` by creating modularized versions of five identified code paths: StartHere component, FractalViewer component, inline CPU worker, cosmic events module, and StartHere CSS.

## Thought Process

The tech debt report identifies five high-impact refactor targets with clear modularization strategies. Rather than attempting all refactors simultaneously, we'll use a phased approach starting with low-risk data extraction, progressing through utility functions, worker externalization, component decomposition, and finally style modularization. This minimizes disruption while maximizing incremental value.

Key considerations:
- Maintain test coverage throughout the process
- Validate each phase before proceeding to next
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Ensure no visual regressions
- Document any deviations from the plan

## Implementation Plan

Following the spec-driven workflow with 5 phases aligned to DESIGN002:

### Phase 1: Data and Configuration Extraction
- Extract cosmic events catalog and resolver
- Move game configuration data to dedicated modules
- Validate with existing tests

### Phase 2: Utility and Helper Extraction
- Create gameplay utility functions (production math, cost formulas, formatters)
- Extract shared fractal math utilities
- Add comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Worker Externalization
- Create external worker file with typed interfaces
- Implement worker factory for lifecycle management
- Update build configuration if needed

### Phase 4: Component Decomposition
- Refactor FractalViewer with hooks and separate modules
- Split StartHere into focused subcomponents
- Validate with visual testing

### Phase 5: Style Modularization
- Create CSS modules for components
- Extract design tokens
- Migrate to Tailwind utilities
