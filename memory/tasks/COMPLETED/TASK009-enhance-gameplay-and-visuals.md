**Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Archived:** 2025-10-10

## Original Request

Enhance gameplay and visuals, make fun assumptions and implement fully.

## Thought Process

The project focused on extending the fractal exploration theme with whimsical lore, interactive mechanics (resource generation, upgrades, events), and visual polish (animated backgrounds, meters, and responsive UI feedback).

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Audit existing components to identify extension points for gameplay features and styling.
- [x] Implement a whimsical resource and event system that makes the fractal frontier feel alive.
- [x] Add visual polish (animations, gradients, thematic styling) to reinforce the narrative.
- [x] Update UI components/pages to surface new mechanics and feedback loops.
- [x] Add automated tests covering new logic and rendering expectations.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
