## Original Request

Create core UI components - resource displays, exploration controls, and upgrade panels.

## Summary of Implementation

The main UI components and layout are implemented and wired into the `StartHere` page:

- `StartHereMenu` (file: `src/app/pages/startheremenu.tsx`) provides StatBadge components for Fractal Data, Data/sec, Zoom Depth, Dimensional Points, Resonance, and Anomalies.
- Upgrade panels and controls are rendered in `src/app/pages/starthere.tsx` using `UPGRADE_CONFIG`, `upgradeCost` and `handleUpgradePurchase` with upgrade rows and purchase buttons.
- Renderer and control buttons (Zoom Deeper / Zoom Out / Stabilise Anomaly / Expeditions) are implemented in `src/app/pages/starthere.tsx` and use shared UI primitives from `@radix-ui/themes`.
- Styling and layout lives in `src/styles/starthere.css` (classes: `.fractal-card`, `.upgrade-card`, `.upgrade-row`, `.fractal-canvas`, etc.).
