## Summary

Automation basics are implemented: passive production derived from upgrades, periodic ticking that updates Fractal Data and depth, and UI to display production numbers. The automation runs via `useEffect` with an interval and is influenced by stabilizers and resonance.

## Reference

- `src/app/pages/starthere.tsx` â€” `dataPerSecond`, `passiveDepthGain`, and the interval `useEffect` that applies production.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
