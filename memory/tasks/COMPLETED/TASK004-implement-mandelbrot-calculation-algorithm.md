# TASK004 - Implement Mandelbrot calculation algorithm

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** October 8, 2025
**Updated:** October 12, 2025
**Archived:** October 12, 2025

## Summary

The Mandelbrot calculation algorithm is implemented both in a GPU shader (for WebGL) and a CPU worker fallback (tile-based). Smooth coloring, iteration capping, palette shifting, and zoom mapping are present in both implementations (`fractalviewer.tsx`).

## Reference

- `src/app/pages/fractalviewer.tsx` â€” shader math and CPU worker implementation

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
