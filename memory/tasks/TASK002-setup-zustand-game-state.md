# [TASK002] - Set up Zustand game state management

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** October 8, 2025
**Updated:** October 8, 2025

## Original Request

Implement Zustand store for managing game state in Fractal Frontier. This includes resource tracking, upgrade states, and persistence to localStorage.

## Thought Process

Game state management is foundational for all gameplay mechanics. We need a robust system that can handle:

- Resource tracking (Fractal Data, exploration points, etc.)
- Upgrade states and effects
- Exploration progress and coordinates
- Achievement tracking
- Persistence across browser sessions

Zustand was chosen for its simplicity, TypeScript support, and middleware capabilities for persistence.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create Zustand store with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Implement resource state (Fractal Data, etc.)
- [ ] Add upgrade system state management
- [ ] Implement localStorage persistence middleware
- [ ] Create actions for resource collection and spending
- [ ] Add exploration state tracking
- [ ] Test state persistence across page reloads
