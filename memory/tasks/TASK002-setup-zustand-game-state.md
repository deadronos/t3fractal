# [TASK002] - Set up Zustand game state management

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** October 8, 2025
**Updated:** 2025-10-26

## Original Request

Implement Zustand store for managing game state in Fractal Frontier. This includes resource tracking, upgrade states, and persistence to localStorage.

## Thought Process

Game state management is foundational for all gameplay mechanics. We need a robust system that can handle:

- Resource tracking (Fractal Data, exploration points, etc.)
- Upgrade states and effects
- Exploration progress and coordinates
- Achievement tracking
- Persistence across browser sessions

Zustand was chosen for its simplicity, TypeScript support, and middleware capabilities for persistence.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Create Zustand store with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Implement resource state (Fractal Data, etc.)
- [x] Add upgrade system state management
- [x] Implement localStorage persistence middleware
- [x] Create actions for resource collection and spending
- [x] Add exploration state tracking
- [x] Test state persistence across page reloads


## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100% Complete

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-09

- Created initial Zustand store skeleton with TypeScript interfaces and basic structure.

### 2025-10-11

- Implemented basic resource counters and core actions (collect/spend). Marked subtasks 2.2 and 2.5 as In Progress to reflect active implementation.

### 2025-10-12

- Next: add persistence middleware (localStorage) and migrate in-page state to the Zustand store; align save/load work to TASK008.

### 2025-10-26

- **Completed full Zustand store implementation** at `src/store/gameStore.ts`
- Implemented comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all game state
- Added all resource management actions (fractalData, dimensionalPoints, resonance, anomalies, etc.)
- Implemented exploration state tracking (depth, complexParameter, expeditionRank)
- Added upgrade system state management with actions
- Implemented localStorage persistence middleware with selective partitioning (only persists game state, not UI state)
- Created 18 comprehensive unit tests covering all store functionality
- **Migrated StartHere component** from useState hooks to Zustand store
- Replaced all local state management with Zustand selectors and actions
- Updated all event handlers and callbacks to use store actions
- **Manually tested in dev server:**
  - Verified initial state loads correctly
  - Tested upgrade purchase (Fractal Probes) - works perfectly
  - Confirmed passive resource generation functions
  - Verified localStorage persistence (state saved with key 'fractal-frontier-game-state')
  - **Tested page reload** - state persists correctly (upgrades, resources all restored)
- All 22 tests passing (18 store tests + 3 other tests + 1 page test)
- TypeScript compilation successful with no errors

## Implementation Details

**Store Structure:**
- State: fractalData, dimensionalPoints, depth, complexParameter, ascensionLevel, amplifiers, resonance, anomalies, expeditionRank, upgrades, eventCountdown, activityLog, lastZone
- Actions: Resource management (add/spend/set), progression (ascend, increment upgrades), exploration (depth, parameters), UI (activity log, event countdown)
- Persistence: Selective partitioning excludes transient UI state (activityLog, eventCountdown) from localStorage

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for all CRUD operations on resources
- Tests for upgrade management
- Tests for ascension mechanics
- Tests for activity log limits
- Tests for anomaly and resonance management

**Migration:**
- Removed 14 useState hooks from StartHere component
- Replaced with Zustand selectors for reactive updates
- Updated all handlers to use store actions instead of setState
- Maintained all existing functionality and game logic
