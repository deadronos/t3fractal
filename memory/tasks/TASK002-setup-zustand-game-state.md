# [TASK002] - Set up Zustand game state management

**Status:** In Progress
**Added:** October 8, 2025
**Updated:** 2025-10-12

## Original Request

Implement Zustand store for managing game state in Fractal Frontier. This includes resource tracking, upgrade states, and persistence to localStorage.

## Thought Process

Game state management is foundational for all gameplay mechanics. We need a robust system that can handle:

- Resource tracking (Fractal Data, exploration points, etc.)
- Upgrade states and effects
- Exploration progress and coordinates
- Achievement tracking
- Persistence across browser sessions

Zustand was chosen for its simplicity, TypeScript support, and middleware capabilities for persistence.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create Zustand store with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Implement resource state (Fractal Data, etc.)
- [ ] Add upgrade system state management
- [ ] Implement localStorage persistence middleware
- [ ] Create actions for resource collection and spending
- [ ] Add exploration state tracking
- [ ] Test state persistence across page reloads


## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 15% Complete

| 2.1 | Create Zustand store structure | Complete | 2025-10-09 | Store skeleton created with interfaces defined |
| 2.2 | Implement resource state | In Progress | 2025-10-11 | Fractal Data counters and basic actions implemented |
| 2.3 | Add upgrade state management | Not Started | - | Upgrade levels and effects |
| 2.4 | Implement persistence middleware | Not Started | - | localStorage integration planned |
| 2.5 | Create resource actions | In Progress | 2025-10-11 | collectResource and spendResource actions added |
| 2.6 | Add exploration state | Not Started | - | Position and zoom tracking |
| 2.7 | Test persistence | Not Started | - | Verify state survives reloads |

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-09

- Created initial Zustand store skeleton with TypeScript interfaces and basic structure.

### 2025-10-11

- Implemented basic resource counters and core actions (collect/spend). Marked subtasks 2.2 and 2.5 as In Progress to reflect active implementation.

### 2025-10-12

- Next: add persistence middleware (localStorage) and migrate in-page state to the Zustand store; align save/load work to TASK008.
