# Project Brief: Fractal Frontier

## Project Overview

Fractal Frontier is an idle game that explores the infinite complexity of fractal universes, blending space exploration with pure mathematics. Players dive into fractals like the Mandelbrot set, collect resources through exploration, automate progress, and ascend through dimensions in this educational and entertaining idle experience.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Fractal Exploration**: Interactive fractal visualization with zoom capabilities
- **Resource Collection**: Primary resource (Fractal Data) collected through exploration
- **Automation System**: Generators that produce resources passively (fractal probes, dimension algorithms)
- **Prestige Mechanics**: Dimensional Ascension system with permanent upgrades
- **Multiple Fractals**: Support for different fractal formulas (Mandelbrot, Julia sets, etc.)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Exponential challenges and rewards

### Technical Requirements

- **Web Application**: Built with T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js + React Three Fiber for fractal rendering
- **State Management**: Zustand for game state persistence
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering for deep fractal exploration

### Quality Requirements

- **Educational Value**: Intuitive understanding of fractals, limits, and chaos theory
- **User Experience**: Engaging idle gameplay with clear progression
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier compliance
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals

1. Create an engaging idle game that teaches fractal mathematics
2. Implement smooth fractal visualization with interactive exploration
3. Build a complete automation and prestige system
4. Deliver a polished web application with modern UI/UX

### Success Criteria

- Functional fractal viewer with zoom controls
- Working resource collection and automation systems
- Dimensional ascension mechanics implemented
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Educational content that explains fractal concepts

## Scope and Constraints

### In Scope

- Core idle game mechanics (exploration, resources, automation)
- Multiple fractal types and visualization
- Prestige system with permanent upgrades
- Basic UI/UX with fractal-themed design
- Unit and E2E testing

### Out of Scope

- Multiplayer features
- Advanced 3D fractal rendering (initially)
- Mobile app versions
- Server-side persistence (client-side only initially)
- Advanced AI-generated content

## Timeline and Milestones

- **Phase 1**: Project setup and basic fractal viewer
- **Phase 2**: Resource collection and automation systems
- **Phase 3**: Prestige mechanics and multiple fractals
- **Phase 4**: Polish, testing, and deployment

## Risk Assessment

- **Technical Risk**: Complex fractal calculations and rendering performance
- **Educational Risk**: Balancing gameplay with mathematical accuracy
- **Scope Risk**: Feature creep with fractal visualization options

## Stakeholders

- **Primary User**: Gamers interested in idle games and mathematics
- **Secondary User**: Students learning about fractals and chaos theory
- **Developer**: Solo developer learning T3 Stack and fractal mathematics
