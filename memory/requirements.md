## Task TASK011 â€“ Refactor Target Identification

1. **WHEN** conducting the tech-debt audit, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** evaluate the codebase using clearly defined modularity criteria and document the criteria in the design artifact.  
   - *Acceptance:* Design document lists criteria applied during assessment.
2. **WHEN** the audit is complete, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** produce recommendations for at least five distinct files or code paths that would benefit from decomposition into smaller modules.  
   - *Acceptance:* `/docs/tech-debt-refactor-report.md` enumerates five unique targets.
3. **WHEN** drafting each recommendation, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** describe the current pain points, proposed modular breakdown, and expected benefits.  
   - *Acceptance:* Each recommendation section includes present issues, suggested refactor direction, and anticipated impact.
4. **WHEN** potential risks or dependencies are identified, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** capture them along with suggested mitigation steps.  
   - *Acceptance:* Report lists dependencies/risks for each target where applicable.
