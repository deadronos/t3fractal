**Learning:** Adding `@radix-ui/themes` `Button` components immediately improves accessibility (keyboard focus, screen reader support) compared to generic `Text` or `div` elements, while also providing built-in visual states (hover, active).
**Action:** Always prefer design system components (`<Button>`) over HTML natives or generic wrappers when available in the stack to ensure consistency and inherited accessibility features.
