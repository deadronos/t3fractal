# The L-System Arboretum: Gameplay Guide

## The Goal

Your goal is to grow a massive, efficient fractal tree. You are "programming" the tree's genetics rather than placing individual blocks.

## 1. The Core Loop

There are two main resources:

*   **Photosynthesis (Green):** Produced by leaves. Depends on **Surface Area** and **Light Exposure**.
*   **Sap (Amber):** Produced by wood volume. Depends on **Tree Volume** and **Root Depth** (how tall/deep the tree structure is).

## 2. Starting Strategy (Spring)

You start in **Spring** with a simple sprout.

1.  **Wait for Photosynthesis:** Your little sprout makes small amounts of energy automatically.
2.  **Buy Iterations:** This is your #1 priority early on.
    *   Go to the **Upgrade Panel** (right side).
    *   Spend Photosynthesis to increase **Iterations** from 3 → 4 → 5.
    *   *Effect:* The tree runs its "code" more times, creating exponentially more branches and leaves.
3.  **Optimize Light (The Angle Dial):**
    *   Look at the **Control Panel** (bottom).
    *   Drag the **Angle Dial**. This changes how wide the branches split.
    *   *Goal:* Make the tree spread out so leaves don't shade each other.
    *   *Indicator:* Watch the **Efficiency** stat. If it's low, your leaves are blocking each other. Widen the angle!

## 3. Scaling Up (Summer)

As the tree gets bigger, you need structure.

1.  **Spend Sap:** You will start earning Sap as the tree creates more wood volume.
2.  **Buy Width:** Increase the girth of the branches. Thicker branches = More Sap = Sturdier look.
3.  **Buy Tick Speed:** Make the entire simulation run faster (more resources per second).
4.  **Unlock Rules:**
    *   Go to the **Genome Panel** (center/left).
    *   Spend resources to unlock better growth patterns like "Crown" (good for light) or "Stretch" (good for height/volume).
    *   *How to use:* Click a symbol (like `X`) and assign a new rule to it. The tree updates instantly.

## 4. Fruiting & Prestige (Autumn & Winter)

1.  **Autumn:** The growth phase ends.
    *   Spend massive amounts of Sap to buy **Fruit**.
    *   Fruit effectively "charges up" your potential seed yield.
2.  **Winter (The Reset):**
    *   Click **Harvest**.
    *   Your tree is destroyed.
    *   You earn **SEEDS** based on your total accumulated energy and fruit.
3.  **The Seed Shop:**
    *   Spend seeds to unlock permanent upgrades: **3D Pitch/Roll** (making the tree 3D instead of flat), **New Shapes** (Cubes/Cones), or an **Auto-Tuner** that plays the game for you.

## Summary: How to Earn

*   **Photosynthesis:** Maximize **Leaf Count** (Iterations) and **Light Efficiency** (Angle).
*   **Sap:** Maximize **Wood Volume** (Width + Iterations) and **Depth** (Tall/Deep trees).
*   **Seeds:** Hoard resources and buy Fruit before resetting in Winter.
