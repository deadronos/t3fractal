# Spec-Driven Workflow — Quick Loop
Hint: use memory folder ( look at .github/instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md for templates)
use /memory/designs folder to store designs
ensure design IDs stay unique across `/memory/designs` and `/memory/designs/COMPLETED`; check both locations before assigning a new number because completed designs may be archived there.
use /memory/tasks folder to store task files
ensure task IDs stay unique across `/memory/tasks` and `/memory/tasks/COMPLETED`; verify both directories before reserving a new number.


Receipt: "Follow a 6-phase spec-driven loop: Analyze → Design → Implement → Validate → Reflect → Handoff."

6-phase micro-plan (one sentence each):

- Analyze: gather facts, write 2–5 EARS-style requirements.
- Design: write a short design (diagram + interfaces) and tasks list.
- Implement: small commits, tests, and update tasks.md as you go.
- Validate: run automated tests, manual checks, and performance verifications.
- Reflect: refactor, update docs, and record technical debt.
- Handoff: prepare PR with executive summary, changelog, tests, and artifacts.

Quick templates

- Requirement (EARS): WHEN <event>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <behavior> [Acceptance: how to test].
- PR summary (3 lines): 1) Goal: <one-line> 2) Key changes: <files/functions> 3) Validation: <tests/metrics>. Attach decision records if any.

Minimal acceptance checklist before merge:

- [ ] 2–5 testable requirements written.
- [ ] Design doc linked in PR.
- [ ] Tests for each requirement (unit/integration).
- [ ] Performance baseline if applicable.
- [ ] Decision records for non-trivial trade-offs.
- [ ] Exec summary and streamlined action log included.

If blocked: re-run Analyze → adjust Confidence Score → pick PoC if medium/low confidence.

End.

- Create a comprehensive technical design and a detailed implementation plan.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Define adaptive execution strategy based on Confidence Score:**
  - **High Confidence (>85%)**
    - Draft a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan.
    - Skip proof-of-concept steps.
    - Proceed with full, automated implementation.
    - Maintain standard comprehensive documentation.
  - **Medium Confidence (66–85%)**
    - Prioritize a **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** or **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.
    - Define clear success criteria for PoC/MVP.
    - Build and validate PoC/MVP first, then expand plan incrementally.
    - Document PoC/MVP goals, execution, and validation results.
  - **Low Confidence (<66%)**
    - Dedicate first phase to research and knowledge-building.
    - Use semantic search and analyze similar implementations.
    - Synthesize findings into a research document.
    - Re-run ANALYZE phase after research.
    - Escalate only if confidence remains low.

  - **Architecture:** High-level overview of components and interactions.
  - **Data Flow:** Diagrams and descriptions.
  - **Interfaces:** API contracts, schemas, public-facing function signatures.
  - **Data Models:** Data structures and database schemas.

> Note: This repository uses a centralized Memory Bank for project context and task tracking. Store design and related artifacts under the `/memory` folder so they are discoverable by agents and maintainers (for example: `memory/designs/design.md`, `memory/requirements.md`).

**Recommended memory placement:**

- Requirements: `memory/requirements.md` (EARS-style requirements)
- Design: `memory/designs/design.md` (architecture, interfaces, diagrams)
- Tasks & plan: `memory/tasks/_index.md` and `memory/tasks/TASKID-*.md`
- Active context & progress: `memory/activeContext.md`, `memory/progress.md`

- [ ] **Document error handling:**

> Store implementation plans and task files inside the memory bank tasks folder (`memory/tasks/`) following the Memory Bank structure required by the project. Use `memory/tasks/_index.md` as the master index and create `memory/tasks/TASKID-taskname.md` for each task.
  - Create an error matrix with procedures and expected responses.

- [ ] **Define unit testing strategy.**

- [ ] **Create implementation plan in `tasks.md`:**
  - For each task, include description, expected outcome, and dependencies.

**Critical Constraint (recommended):**

- Prefer to complete design and a minimal validated plan before large-scope implementation. For low-risk changes it may be acceptable to iterate with small, test-backed increments; when deviating, document the deviation and seek owner approval where practical.

### **Phase 3: IMPLEMENT**

**Objective:**

- Write production-quality code according to the design and plan.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Code in small, testable increments. - Document each increment with code changes, results, and test links.
- [ ] Implement from dependencies upward. - Document resolution order, justification, and verification.
- [ ] Follow conventions. - Document adherence and any deviations with a Decision Record.
- [ ] Add meaningful comments. - Focus on intent ("why"), not mechanics ("what").
- [ ] Create files as planned. - Document file creation log.
- [ ] Update task status in real time.

**Critical Constraint (recommended):**

- Aim to document and test implementation steps before merge/deploy. In emergency or experimental scenarios, prefer feature branches and clear risk notes; when merging incomplete work, obtain owner/maintainer approval if possible.

### **Phase 4: VALIDATE**

**Objective:**

- Verify that implementation meets all requirements and quality standards.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Execute automated tests. - Document outputs, logs, and coverage reports. - For failures, document root cause analysis and remediation.
- [ ] Perform manual verification if necessary. - Document procedures, checklists, and results.
- [ ] Test edge cases and errors. - Document results and evidence of correct error handling.
- [ ] Verify performance. - Document metrics and profile critical sections.
- [ ] Log execution traces. - Document path analysis and runtime behavior.

**Critical Constraint (recommended):**

- Prefer to complete validation steps and resolve critical issues before proceeding. For non-blocking items, triage with maintainers and document outstanding issues in the PR.

### **Phase 5: REFLECT**

**Objective:**

- Improve codebase, update documentation, and analyze performance.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Refactor for maintainability. - Document decisions, before/after comparisons, and impact.
- [ ] Update all project documentation. - Ensure all READMEs, diagrams, and comments are current.
- [ ] Identify potential improvements. - Document backlog with prioritization.
- [ ] Validate success criteria. - Document final verification matrix.
- [ ] Perform meta-analysis. - Reflect on efficiency, tool usage, and protocol adherence.
- [ ] Auto-create technical debt issues. - Document inventory and remediation plans.

**Critical Constraint (recommended):**

- Prefer to close the phase only after documentation and improvement actions are recorded; if exceptional circumstances require early closure, log the reason and follow up with a retrospective.

### **Phase 6: HANDOFF**

**Objective:**

- Package work for review and deployment, and transition to next task.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Generate executive summary. - Use **Compressed Decision Record** format.
- [ ] Prepare pull request (if applicable):
  1. Executive summary.
  2. Changelog from **Streamlined Action Log**.
  3. Links to validation artifacts and Decision Records.
  4. Links to final `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`.
- [ ] Finalize workspace. - Archive intermediate files, logs, and temporary artifacts to `.agent_work/`.
- [ ] Continue to next task. - Document transition or completion.

**Critical Constraint (recommended):**

- Consider tasks complete when the core acceptance criteria are met and handoff notes are provided; follow team conventions for required documentation and approvals before final closure.

## Troubleshooting & Retry Protocol

**If you encounter errors, ambiguities, or blockers:**

**Checklist:**

1. **Re-analyze**:
   - Revisit the ANALYZE phase.
   - Confirm all requirements and constraints are clear and complete.
2. **Re-design**:
   - Revisit the DESIGN phase.
   - Update technical design, plans, or dependencies as needed.
3. **Re-plan**:
   - Adjust the implementation plan in `tasks.md` to address new findings.
4. **Retry execution**:
   - Re-execute failed steps with corrected parameters or logic.
5. **Escalate**:
   - If the issue persists after retries, follow the escalation protocol.

**Critical Constraint (recommended):**

- Avoid proceeding with unresolved errors or ambiguities when feasible; if a pragmatic exception is required, clearly document the risks, mitigation, and plan to resolve outstanding items.

## Technical Debt Management (Automated)

### Identification & Documentation

- **Code Quality**: Continuously assess code quality during implementation using static analysis.
- **Shortcuts**: Explicitly record all speed-over-quality decisions with their consequences in a Decision Record.
- **Workspace**: Monitor for organizational drift and naming inconsistencies.
- **Documentation**: Track incomplete, outdated, or missing documentation.
